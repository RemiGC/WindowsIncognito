This small program will lock all the content of the folder %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations so that any program that try to modify the files will receive a file already in use.

This way you can navigate on your computer in an anymous way a little like Incognito mode on browser.

The program come with the file AppIDList.xml wich countain the name of some application compiled on http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/List_of_Jump_List_IDs
